##### Description 

The purpose of this project is to showcase the skills that were learned throughout the Web Page Development Class. The website was built from weekly assignments. Each week we learned about the different elements of web development, learning HTML and CSS syntax along the way. Each component was built individually. Starting on Week 3, we began to add HTML, images, and links to the web site. This is when we added the first image, an avatar named BOB. In week 4, we set up the Github and Netlify accounts for the website. I learned the importance of GitHub and how it's version control capabilites help organize a coding project. In week 5, we added a CSS style sheet and applied a color scheme. It was incredible to learn how efficient and useful having a CSS style sheet is. Being able to change the styling of a page without having to change the HTML was crucial to learn, as I ended up having to change my color scheme later on. Without the CSS style sheet, this change would have been time consuming. In week 6, photos and a hobbies list was added to the website. This was the week that we learned the box model, which was the foundation for learning about flexbox and grid layouts later. We also learned about Pseudoclasses and Pseudoelements, which gave us the information to make more specific changes to the webpage. The pseudoclasses for links, such as :hover, :visited, etc., were especially helpful. Week 7 is when we applied the knowledge of the box model to use grid & flexbox to have greater control over the layout of the page. We also used grid & flex to create more responsive designs. In week 10 we added a web form and in week 11 we added a nav bar. All of these different elements were built one by one to create a single, cohesive page.

##### Color Scheme 

I orginally picked a horrible color scheme during week 5. While choosing a color scheme in Adobe Color Wheel, I was so focused on trying to get a scheme that passed the color blind safe check that I completely forgot the fundamentals of accessible color design. I picked a terrible red-green color scheme. Red and green are bad colors to pick together because red-green color blindness is the most common type of color blindness. Even though the palette passed the different color blindess checks on Adobe Color Wheel, it was a fundamental mistake on my part. The reds were #AD0011, #FF9EA8, and #FA818D. The greens were #3DAD56 and #82FA9D. During the final steps of creating the About Me, I decided to completely change the color scheme. The contrasts for the previous scheme were horrid. I decided to change it to a blue-orange scheme. The three shades of blue are #0820A9, #80B4FF, and #00F6E6. #0820A9 is the dark blue, #80B4FF is the periwinkle shade, and #00F6E6 is the cyan. The orange is #FA7331 and the the dark, reddish orange is #A71700. This new scheme was a lot better for contrast and readability. #00F6E6 text on a #0820A9 background had an excellent contrast ratio of 8.56, which meets the AAA standard. Having the CSS style sheet allowed this huge change to be quick and painless. Overall, I'm much more satisfied with the new color scheme. The blues are cool and calming while the cyan provides great contrast. The oranges also add warmth to the page.

##### Reflections

I found the structure of this project and the class to be engaging and informative. Learning about each the different elements weekly and then applying them to the project was a great way to apply what we learned. It was very satisfying to see everything come together at the end to form the website. Creating the web form was my favorite part of the About Me project. I found both HTML and CSS easy to learn. However, I struggle to remember all the different syntax for CSS, so VSCode's code completion feature helps in this aspect. I plan on practicing using flexbox and grid more because of it's importance in responsive design. 

At the start of the class, I didn't think web design was all that important because of how often I use my phone over my laptop. I incorrectly believed that applications on phones was the only type of interface that mattered. But as the class progressed, I started to realize the importance of web design more and more. Even on my phone, I use the Safari app to browse through the internet frequently and I began to notice more examples of unresponsive web design. By the end of the class, I saw how fundamental building web pages is to interface design as a whole. Even with how dominant applications on phones are, a lot of time is also spent on web pages. I've come to value web design and I see now how the fundamentals of developing a web page applies to creating applications. I truly appreciate how this class changed my view on web pages. Thank you for teaching this class Professor Caruso.
